This is a project where Fien Denblinden and Jari Miers will be working on. This is our bachelor assesment for our degree Multimedia and Creative Technologies.

We want to solve the problem of food waste for family's and company's.

People don't really know what exactly is in there fridge. 
We will solve this using creative technologies such as raspberry pi, python, javascript, product design and much more.

Use case:

    1. Being at the shop and you forgot what you have in the fridge. Then you can use our app to know what is inside your fridge.
   

    2. What about knowing how much weight a pack of chicken weighs and what the expiration date is. You can cook precisely for your family or guests.


    3. Everything inside your fridge will be sorted on expiration date.
